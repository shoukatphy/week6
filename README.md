# week6 (Numerical Integration)
This program should operate for two different types of the numerical integration: ``` the fixed interval size```  and the ```Gaussain qaudrature rule```. The output will also show the result I have obtained analytical integration.  

## How to Run the Program
This code can be run through *`ROOT`*. In case you don't have it in your system, you can install from here [https://root.cern/install/](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md). The root macro will ask you to pass three arguments. 
Type the commad <> **`root `** in the terminal and open the root in the terminal, then type root[0] **`.x Integral.C(double (Lower limit), double (upper Limit), int (Num of steps))`**
