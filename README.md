# week6 (Numerical Integration)
This program should operate for two different types of the numerical integration: '''bash the fixed interval size'''  and the *Gaussain qaudrature rule*. It works for that case. But could not get the plots properly.  

## How to Run the Program
This code can be run through *`ROOT`*. In case you don't have it in your system, you can install from here [https://root.cern/install/](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md). 
Type the commad <> **`root randm2.C`** in the terminal or open the root in the terminal type root[0] **`.x randm2.C`**
